GestureControl Mouse
GestureControl Mouse is an innovative project that enables users to control their mouse using hand gestures detected through a webcam. It leverages MediaPipe for hand tracking and PyAutoGUI for mouse control, allowing you to perform mouse movements, clicks, and scrolling without touching the mouse.

Features :--
Mouse Movement: Move the cursor using your index finger.
Click: Perform a click by bringing your thumb and index finger close together.
Scroll: Scroll up or down by changing the relative vertical position of your thumb and index finger.
